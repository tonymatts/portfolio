To install web2py and pbs_site:
-------------------------------
**Linux and Unix**

Here is a good explanation of how to install web2py:
http://jdoe.asidev.com/2009/02/26/configure-web2py-to-run-behind-apache-with-wsgi-mod_wsgi/


I was not able to install pbs_site by providing the git URL, but have installed it successfully as follows:  First, clone the repository into a temp directory, then tar the files like so:
```bash
cd temp_dir/pbs_site
tar zcvf web2py.app.name.w2p *
```
Then install the "packed" application in the web2py admin interface.  Afther this, remove the directory ```applications/pbs_site``` and copy the ```pbs_site``` directory from ```temp_dir``` into the ```applications``` directory where you just deleted the ```pbs_site``` folder.  You will now be able to perform all the necessary commits and such that you need.


One step production deployment
------------------------------
Here are some steps to install apache+python+mod_wsgi+web2py+postgresql from scratch.

On Ubuntu:
```bash
wget http://web2py.googlecode.com/hg/scripts/setup-web2py-ubuntu.sh 
chmod +x setup-web2py-ubuntu.sh
sudo ./setup-web2py-ubuntu.sh
```

On Fedora:
```bash
wget http://web2py.googlecode.com/hg/scripts/setup-web2py-fedora.sh
chmod +x setup-web2py-fedora.sh
sudo ./setup-web2py-fedora.sh
```

Both of these scripts should run out of the box, but every Linux installation is a bit different, so make sure you check the source code of these scripts before you run them. In the case of Ubuntu, most of what they do is explained in the link below.

Once this is installed, you can go to https://localhost, click "admin interface" and then "Upload and install packed application."  You can copy the git address above (https://github.com/pf4d/pbs_site) to the "Or get from URL" box and install.

Google Maps

The script used to display googlemaps is called gmaps.js and is located in the static/js directory.  A detailed explanation of its usage is found at http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/
